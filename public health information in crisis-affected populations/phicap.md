# Public health assessments among crisis-affected populations – a practical guide for implementers

- In general, start with basic principles needed for setting up a logical, sensible assessment, then follow with practical guides, examples in the annex, job profiles for enqueteurs, order supplies, training plans, etc

## Introduction

- Who is this book aimed at?
    + humanitarian organisations with public health support but not necessarily trained, experienced epidemiologists
    + this will provide an overview of why we do things, relatively light description of the methods involved (but needs to cover everything essential [guiding principle will be no need to search elsewhere for practical launching, only if interested in greater detail] - with links/refs to further reading if neccessary) - this will be unique selling-point (will not be heavy or scary for end-users) - allowing end-users to roll-out PHAs with fair confidence of methods and issues to consider
    + Note provision of free R package (epidemos) for analsyis of all types of PHA based on arguments to functions provided
- use and utility of PHACAPs
    + need for evidence-based decision-making, etc (Darcy & Hoffman)
    + essential that methods are appropriate (Speigel & Prudhon)
- timing of assessments (health cluster guide)
- when and whether to launch assessments
- 

## Assessments
- Rapid, inter-sectoral assessments (MIRA-style) *
- In-depth Health/Nutrition (capacity?) assessment (3W & HeRAMS)

## Surveys - essential variables to include, principles for additions
- Introduction
    + definition of survey
    + purpose
        * in-depth snapshot of a population
    + strengths vs. limitations
        * rigorous scientific methods
        * representative
        * generalisability issues
        * sample size considerations (design effect, etc)

- general survey design
    + exhaustive survey
        * advantages & disadvantages
    + systematic survey
        * advantages & disadvantages
        * calculation of 
    + simple random sampling
        * advantages & disadvantages
    + 2-stage cluster survey
        * advantages & disadvantages

- specific health-related surveys
    + nutrition
        * aims
        * variables
        * issues to consider
    + mortality 
    + vacc. coverage
    + health status (?)
    + access to hc/basic needs [proportions - can add others of interest]

## Surveillance
- Infectious diseases (this is very important – a clear, concise reference document on this would be enormously important)
    - Included in these would be off-the-shelf briefing sheets (with elements to fill out for specifics) for each of the major diseases that tend to show up after crises
- Mortality and malnutrition
